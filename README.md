  1. About this project
  
  This is the Restaurant review project (stage 1), which is the project 5 for FEND Nanodegree with Udacity.
  We used the starter code with Google maps. I have reverted the port to standard 8000 for ease of use. 
  Please see details on installation and resources below. Thanks for taking the time to have a look!

  I have used many resources in doing this project as it was a challenging one!
  Please find a list of general resources below. I have also included specific quotes in the main.js file. 
  The webinar of Doug Brown was a great starting point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92dtrNU1GQc
  I have read and followed Matthew Cranford's tutorials, but I used Google maps API Key:        https://matthewcranford.com/restaurant-reviews-app-walkthrough-part-1-map-api/
  I have read the Udacity course lessons on Google maps API (part 5, lesson 7: Getting started with the APIs) and the         tutorials in the actual Google MAPS once I signed up for a Google Maps key.
